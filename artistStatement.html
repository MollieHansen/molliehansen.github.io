      <p>One of the greatest adaptations in the natural world and within humanity is the ability to evolve, grow, and transform. Moles appear on the body and moss develops on a tree, which is beautifully decorative, yet divulges our own decay. I am a collector of progressing time. In my installations, I cultivate examples of perpetual sequences, allowing the viewer to pause and acknowledge these greater cycles of being.</p>
      <p>These projects exist as environments that confront people with uncanny and ornamental representations of the natural world moving on without them. Glass has become my symbol for the contradictory of human existence. This manifests in through the exploration of domestic and familial recreation with glass as the material. I expose the relationship between what is loved and deprived valued and neglected, accessible and precious in the constant metamorphoses of life.</p>
