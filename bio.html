    <p>Glass, with its multifarious qualities, has proven itself to be the perfect medium for Ms. Hansen to encapsulate fragile cycles of existence. Her mixed media installations utilize glass to express the delicate relationships between what is precious and what is degraded.</p>
    <p>Ms. Hansen discovered her passion for glass in Detroit at Epiphany Studios. She went on to earn her Bachelor’s Degree in Studio Art and Art History from Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, while working as an artist assistant to her professor, Stephen Powell. After School, Ms. Hansen participated in the renowned Chrysler Museum of Art Glass Studio Assistantship Program. She currently resides in Seattle, Washington working as a glass instructor and creating her glasswork.</p>
